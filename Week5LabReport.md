> Explanation: the `grep -r` command followed by a pattern searches recursively for that pattern

[cs15lwi23atp@ieng6-202]:skill-demo1-data:272$ grep -r "Bixiaci" --include=*.txt written_2\

The Tang Dynasty Rock Inscriptions (Moyabei) were struck in large gold-foil characters to record\ 
Emperor Xuanzongâ€™s imperial pilgrimage in the year 726. The Stele Without Inscription (Wuzibei)\

> Explanation: This variation of the `grep -r` command will also search for the given pattern but

- Using `-l` option
1.
```
[cs15lwi23atp@ieng6-202]:skill-demo1-data:285$ grep -rl Hawaii written_2
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRHawaii.txt

```
> Explanation: the `grep -l` option allows use to print the names of the files that contain a match\
> for the specified pattern. here we use `grep -rl` in order to search recursively in `written_2` and\
> print just the name of the file that has the word `jetfoil`. This option is useful because it lets
> us just see the file names and not have all this messy text in front of us.
