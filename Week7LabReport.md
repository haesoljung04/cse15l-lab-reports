The `sshcs15lwi23atp@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command was 1 up in the search history, so I used the up arrow to access it and the enter key to run it.

### 5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

The `git clone https://github.com/haesoljung04/lab7` command was 12 up in the search history, so I used the up arrow to access it and the enter key to run.

### 6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

The `cd lab7` command allowed me to change directory into the forked repo so that I could run the tests and pressing the up key 15 times allowed me to access the command `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` and pressing it 13 times allowed me to access `java -cp.:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore`. These 2 commands allow us to compile and run the JUnit tests respectively.

### 7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test

The `nano ListExamples.java` command was 5 up arrow keys up so I rant that like that and then I found the first error I need to fix by using `ctrl + W` which allows me to find the position of the characters I am searching for. I was searching for the `0, s` expression so I input that and entered which brought me to the error and from there i used trhe arrow keys to delete the `0` part and thereby I fixed the first error. I did the same thing to fix the second error and then i did `ctrl + o` to save the changes and `ctrl + x` to exit the nano interface.


### 8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed

Pressing the up key 3 times allowed me to access the command `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` and pressing it 2 times allowed me to access `java -cp.:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore`. These 2 commands allow us to recompile and run the JUnit tests respectively.
### 9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account

> Keys Pressed: `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>`,`<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>`

Pressing the up key 11 times allowed me to use the command `git add ListExamples.java` which commits the changes and pressing the up key 10 times allowed me to use the command `git commit -m "updated"` allowing me to the push the changes to my GitHub account and sending a message to confirm success.
