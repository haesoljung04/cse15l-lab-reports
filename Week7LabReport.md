The `sshcs15lwi23atp@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command was 1 up in the search history,\
so I used the up arrow to access it and the enter key to run it.

### 5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

The `gitclone https://github.com/haesoljung04/lab7` command was 12 up in the\
search history, so I used the up arrow to access it and the enter key to run.

### 6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

The `cd lab7` command allowed me to change directory into the forked repo\
so that I could run the tests and pressing the up key 15 times allowed me to access\
the command `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java`\
and pressing it 13 times allowed me to access `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:\
lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore`. These 2 commands allow us to
compile and run the JUnit tests respectively.

### 7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
\
### 8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
\
### 9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account
