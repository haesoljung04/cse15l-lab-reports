# Week 1 Lab Report
*How to log into a course-specific account on ieng6*
## 1. Installing Visual Studio Code
Go to the official Visual Studio Code [website](https://code.visualstudio.com) and download the correct version of VS Code\
according to your operating system. Follow the instructions to complete the installation and when finished, you should\
be able to open a tab that looks like the image below\
\

## 2. Resetting your CSE 15L Account
First find your course-specific account for this course at this [website](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php).\
Then from there a link that allows you to reset your password should appear.\
From this point on everything should be fairly intuitive but if not, feel free\
to use this [tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit) to help navigate the process!

## 3. Remotely Connecting your terminal to UCSD CSE
> If you are on Mac, please skip to step number 3.

1. Install **git** for Windows using this [download link](https://gitforwindows.org)
2. Change your default terminal to use the just-installed **git bash** in Visual Studio Code using these [instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal)
3. To use ssh, open a new terminal in VS Code by pressing **Ctrl(Windows) or Command(Mac) + `**
4. In the terminal, type the following comand except with "zz" replaced by your individual course-specific account's letters.
`ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
5. After pressing enter, you should receive a message not unlike the one below:
```
â¤‡ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```
6. Now, type "yes" in the terminal and right after, when prompted for a password, enter the new password you made previously\
in the section "Resetting your CSE 15L Account". If you have succesfully logged in, you should see a message similar to this:

> NOTE: there will be no visible characters when typing out your password but it is a common terminal feature that is used\
> to protect your privacy.

**Congrats!** You have successfully connected your computer(the client) to a computer in the CSE Basement(the server).\
Any commands you run now will run on that server. How exciting!
