# Week 5 Lab Report
## Researching Commands: `grep`
- **Using `-r` option**
1.
```

```
> Explanation: the `grep -r` command followed by a pattern searches recursively for that pattern
> in all the files of a directory and its subdirectories. In the code block above, we can see 
> that this is useful when we would like to find the file that contains a specific word.

```
[cs15lwi23atp@ieng6-202]:skill-demo1-data:272$ grep -r "Bixiaci" --include=*.txt written_2\
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/China-WhereToGo.txt:On the summit there are even more treasures.\ 
The Tang Dynasty Rock Inscriptions (Moyabei) were struck in large gold-foil characters to record\ 
Emperor Xuanzongâ€™s imperial pilgrimage in the year 726. The Stele Without Inscription (Wuzibei)\ 
is blank, thought to have been placed here by the First Emperor over 2,000 years earlier; everyone\ 
who reaches it must touch it for good luck. The Temple of the Purple Dawn (Bixiaci)
```
> Explanation: This variation of the `grep -r` command will also search for the given pattern but
> the `--include` option allows us to specify the file extension to search in. In this case, we
> only want to search in txt files so we put `*.txt`. This is useful because we can tell the computer
> we only want to see text files.

- **Using `-l` option**
1.
```
[cs15lwi23atp@ieng6-202]:skill-demo1-data:285$ grep -rl Hawaii written_2
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRHawaii.txt
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HistoryHawaii.txt
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HistoryMalaysia.txt
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhatToHawaii.txt
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToHawaii.txt
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-Intro.txt
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/California-History.txt
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/California-WhatToDo.txt
```
> Explanation: the `grep -l` option allows use to print the names of the files that contain a match\
> for the specified pattern. here we use `grep -rl` in order to search recursively in `written_2` and\
> print just the name of the file that has the word `Hawaii`. This option is useful because it lets
> us just see the file names and not have all this messy text in front of us.

[cs15lwi23atp@ieng6-202]:skill-demo1-data:286$ grep -rl Emperor --exclude=*.{jpg,png} written_2
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HistoryFrance.txt

written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HistoryIstanbul.txt
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HistoryItaly.txt
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HistoryJapan.txt
```
> Explanation: the use of `--exclude=` allows use to exlude certain types of files by specifying file
> types in braces. In this case we exclude our search from `{jpg,png}` files. This is useful if you are
> looking for certain types of files.

- **Using `n` option**
1.
```
[cs15lwi23atp@ieng6-202]:skill-demo1-data:287$ grep -n Emperor written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt
18:The best known image of Puerto Vallarta is the Iglesia de Guadalupe (Guadalupe Church), dedicated to the Virgin of
Guadalupe, and topped by a copy of the crown worn by Empress Carlota in the 1860s. Wife of Emperor Maximillian
```
> Explanation: the `grep -n` option allows use to search for a specific pattern in a file and print the line numbers of
> the matching lines. This is useful because if we know the file that has a specific pattern like `Emperor` we are able
> to get the exact line number in which it appears using this command.
